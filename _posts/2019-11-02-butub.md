Written in `Bash`, `butub` is a minimalist, text-based video downloader and converter. It is free software and allows you to:

* choose default folders in which to put your downloaded video and music files
* download videos from popular websites
* convert them to a number of audio file formats

### Installation on Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic beaver) or derivatives

You can install it via my PPA

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:shelllavie/gandelias
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install butub
```

Once installed, you can invoke the program from the terminal or via GUI.

### Using the program

The first time you run it, `butub` will take care of resolving dependency issues. It will also ask you for the default *Video* and *Music* folders.

Once properly configured, `butub` will ask you for the title and path of the video you want to download:

After that, just follow the instruction on the screen.

Alternatively you can learn how to use the program by reading its manpage:

```bash
man butub
```

Or by using the `--help` option:

```bash
butub --help
```


Halof!

#### Notes

+ Both `.deb` and `.rpm` packages could be available shortly if I find some spare time to do the packaging.
